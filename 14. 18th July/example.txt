1. What IS Abstraction?
Abstraction in JavaScript refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a piece of code and only showing the necessary features or functionalities to the outside world. It allows developers to work at higher levels of understanding by simplifying the interaction with code components.
Abstraction is crucial for building maintainable and scalable applications. It promotes code reusability, enhances readability, and reduces the complexity of understanding and maintaining codebase.
